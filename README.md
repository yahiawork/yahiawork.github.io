# Yahia Saad — Portfolio (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Quick start
- Put your real photo as `pic.png` in the root (same folder as index.html).
- Edit links in `assets/app.js` (email / discord / CV).
- Replace project cards in `projects.html` with your real projects.

## Run locally
Browsers may block `fetch()` on `file://`.
Use a tiny local server:
- Python: `python -m http.server 8080`
Then open: `http://localhost:8080`

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
Upload this folder to a repo, enable Pages, done.
